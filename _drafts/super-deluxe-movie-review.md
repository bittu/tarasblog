Super deluxe.

It took a whole night to process , what I just saw. I always feel in life , there is nothing wrong and everything is circumstantial. Love , lust, anger, stress, fear, break down everything is for a moment . No human , can feel this entire time . Everything is for a moment . But we live in a fantasy of our own world , with saying this is rules and abide the society and follow the customs and whatsoever.

Big salute to ,ThyagarajaKumaraja for portraying non filtered version of his mind and thoughts. A film should always be raw , more raw it is , more impact it would make is the basic . Director has delivered his kind , in competition with his previous movie . Seriously , I don't think this guy , gives a damn about other directors or nothing.

I can write and write and write , but won't find precise words to describe Super deluxe. Technically , screenplay , direction , acting everything was top notch. I am just listing my favourite order of actors from the movie , who were out of the box .

1\. Rasu kutty - Kid was the best in the movie . Not even in a single frame , he stumbled .   
2\. Boys - All five.   
3\. Ramya Krishnan  
4\. Fahad   
5 . Shilpa - Vijay Sethupathi   
6\. Samantha - vembu. So glad , actress had the courage to do out of the box roles for the first time .   
7 . Mysskin

Whoever , whatever they performed and lived as the character , entire credit goes to the director , without a doubt .

Cinematography and art were visually world class .

Ellathaiyum paathutu , ipdi lam irukuma enna nu nenachaalum , your mind set thaan . Aama , practicality nenachaalum your mind set daan.

Go watch Super Deluxe.
